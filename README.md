## Problem Statement
Respiratory diseases are increasing with increase in pollution and lifestyle comforts. Monitoring Lung capacity @ home with an easy to use apparatus is the objective of this Problem. Most spirometers are manual and do not have a digital display to check lung capacity

This problem has the following dimensions

- Augment/retrofit Spirometers with a digital display to measure Respiratory Inhalation and Exhalation volume
- OR You can even use any other IOT sensor or Smartphone based solution to measure above

## Spirometry 

A spirometer is a device that is used to measure the flow of breath in and out of the lungs. This device is used in a medical testing procedure known as spirometry, in which a patient breathes in and out of a tube connected to the spirometer so that lung function can be assessed.

## Proposed Solution 
Our proposed solution consisted of construction of a portable Spirometer. The flow and volume inside the device is calculated using Bernoulli equation along with the Venturi effect. Whenever the patient blows out in the Spirometer various Spirometry parameters are derived based on flow and volume calculated from the readings generated by the sensor and the Bernoulli-Venturi flow equation applied on it.

## Construction of the Device
The construction of the handheld device is done using PVC pipe as the device needs to be cost effective and reliable. The device is also connected to a Differential Pressure Sensor which will calculate the differential Pressure in the tube. The differential pressure sensor is interfaced to an Arduino Uno.

## Hardware Requirements
- MPX5010DP Sensor (Differential Pressure Sensor)
- Arduino Uno

## Working of the solution
The patient is required to blow out inside the Spirometer for the calculations of various Spirometry Parameters such as FEV1, FVC, PEFR, etc. The differential pressure readings is sent to the Arduino by MPX5010DP Sensor. The input given to the arduino is then used to calculate the flow and volume of the air blown out by the patient. Based on these readings derived from the Bernoulli-Venturi equation, various Spirometry parameters are derived.
